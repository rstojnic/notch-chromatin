Chromatin states in fly cell lines
======

This repository contains the supplementary data for the (Skalska et al, 2014) paper. In the paper we derive chromatin states in the fly (D. melanogaster) cell lines: BG3, Kc167 (with H3K56ac) and S2 (without H3K56ac). The states are derived for the steady state and Notch activation conditions. 

Directory structure:

* [data/](https://github.com/rstojnic/notch-chromatin/tree/master/data) - Raw data used to infer chromatin states. 
* [states/](https://github.com/rstojnic/notch-chromatin/tree/master/states/) - Chromatin states as BED files. 
* [scripts/](https://github.com/rstojnic/notch-chromatin/tree/master/scripts/) - Scripts used to derive the chromatin states.
