Chromatin states in fly cell lines
======

This repository contains the supplementary data for the (Skalska et al, 2015) paper. In the paper we derive chromatin states in the fly (D. melanogaster) cell lines: BG3, Kc167 (with H3K56ac) and S2 (without H3K56ac). The states are derived for the steady state and Notch activation conditions.
